This is an example client application written in JavaScript that demonstrates how to use the Spring Social ORCID RESTful web service (https://github.com/EuropePMC/spring-social-orcid-rest-ws-example/tree/master/spring-social-orcid-rest-ws-server).

Users can sign into the client web application via the Spring Social ORCID web service through ORCID.

Have fun, and all the best!
